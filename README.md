# PLANT-MONITORING-SYSTEM
“Plant Monitoring System” project is the implementation of the technology with nature using both hardware and software. To handle crops while staying a long way from it along with the right knowledge on the soil type, availability of water, diseases or pests and other requirements necessary for it’s best growth is achieved through this system. 


The proposed system works on integrated sensors to perform different tasks like checking for water/moisture level in soil, detect for pests and animal interruptions and suitable temperature for the plants’ healthy growth. These information sensed by the sensors are sent directly to the farmers’ or the users’ mobile application with many related meters of different parameters being measured along with the option to irrigate the crops or the plants from the  residing place through the mobile application when in need.


The proposed system contains following sensors:
  #1 sensor to determine the  moisture content 
  #2 temperature /humidity sensor.
  #3 PIR sensor 


Smart Plant Monitoring systems are mostly needed for small farmers with less than 1 or 2 hectare of land, for novice farm workers or small scale gardeners who are employed to take care for the gardens or grounds of a home with few variety of plants. So, local needs-based customers are the main target of our proposed system.
